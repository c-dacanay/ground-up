# ðŸŒ· 100 Days, 1 Season
This project took a little less than my first full summer season tending to edible crops and a backyard. In that time the cherry tomatoes and cucumbers spilled over a trellis nearly twice my height, the hydrangeas bloomed in the shade of the mullberries, and the clover flushed and fell every few weeks. Oxalis and ivy crept up the fences and my neighbor's bitter melon plant tangled itself on the top of the smokebush. I met beetles, slugs, leafhoppers, worms, and found bees napping between soft petals. I bit into a homegrown bell pepper like an apple and it tasted sweet.

100 days always feels like a long time but paying attention to the seasons makes me feel like the whole world has changed. Mulch has rotted into the soil. The aphids and ants aren't nearly as present as they were in early spring. The gypsophila that the hoverflies favored died off in early July and since then only larger honey and carpenter bees have been visiting the flower patch. The long-growing lavender that I started in April is just now bushing out and I hope it can overwinter safely to bloom in spring next year, 200 days from now. 

The classic format of 100 days best rewards true commitment that I shirked this time around. I encourage participants who took the summer session easy take a winter session seriously for maximum payoff. Still I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to reflect and share my garden with everyone. It was a good summer filled with spice, herbs, and tomatoes. Looking forward to seasons to come, may we spend them however we wish. ðŸ’–
