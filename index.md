I'm coming up on 10 years in Brooklyn. Despite the concrete, many flora and fauna have found a way to survive in the city, and it's about time I get to know them! This project a field guide to my own yard and the 8 blocks around my apartment. I'd like to check in on the flora and fauna on my daily dog walks as I would my neighbors! At the same time I want to deepen my knowledge of the history of the land I occupy, gardening practices, and ecology.

#### Criteria
- Articles should aim to be educational
- Articles should be written for a general audience
- Articles should be surprising or delightful <code>(fun facts! nice drawings!)</code>

#### Constraints
- I don't need to finish an article every day, but every day should contribute to one
- Pure research does not count as a day! There needs to be interpretation, even if they're just notes
- I can write, draw, take photos, and go on field trips in any combination
- Honestly we're taking it easy on this one
