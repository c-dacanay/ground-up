# üå± About the Project
I'm coming up on 10 years in Brooklyn. Many flora and fauna have found a way to survive in the city despite the concrete, and it's about time I get to know them! This project is a field guide to my own yard and the 8 blocks around my apartment. I'd like to know the sidewalk shrubs as well as I do the local restaurants. At the same time I'll deepen my knowledge of the history of the land I occupy, gardening practices, and ecology.

#### Criteria
- Articles should be educational but casual
- Articles should have **local information** written for a general audience
- Articles should be surprising or delightful <code>(fun facts! nice drawings!)</code>

#### Constraints
- I don't need to finish an article every day, but every day should contribute to one
- Research does not count as a day. There must be interpretation.
- I can write, doodle, take photos, and go on field trips in any combination
- Honestly I'm taking it easy on this one.

<!-- #### Todos: 
- Soil: Worm, Fungi
- Trees: Princess Tree
- Groundcover: Chickweed, Oxalis
- Herbs & Flowers: Snapdragon, Gypsophilia 
- Crops: Bush Beans
- Animals: Mourning Dove, American Robin -->

## Books on Gardening
**In Progress:** The New Organic Grower, Eliot Coleman

### ‚≠êÔ∏è How to Grow More Vegetables, John Jeavons
I'll keep an eye out for this book in stores. It was written in the 70s out of [Ecology Acton's Grow Biointensive](http://www.growbiointensive.org/), after environmentalists and ecologists began pushing back on methods of industrial farming that dominated American food production. It covers everything from soil, sustainability practices, to extremely detailed master planting charts. It's rather inspirational to see that many ideas in this book have permeated into common knowledge for anyone with even a passing interest in organic gardening.
#### Highlights
- Really interesting root system diagrams that show that most of our food crops don't grow more than 4 feet deep with the exception of root crops like carrots and beets.
- On compost: "Humus includes the living and dead bodies of microbial life. As humus is formed, nitrogen becomes part of its structure. This stabilizes nitrogen in the soil because the humus compounds are resistant to decomposition... Humus also acts as a site of nutrient absorption (accumulation of nutrients on its surface) and exchange for plants in the soil." [47]
- "Generally, the elements needed for growth fall into two categories: terrestrial (soil and nutrients) and celestial (air, warmth, moisture)... Plants can take in air through their roots as well as through their leaves. Nutrients can also be borne upon air currents." [78] Leaves are roots in the air, roots are leaves in the soil.
- On weeding: "There really is no such thing as weed... Instead of weeding indiscriminately, you should learn the natures of uses of different weeds so you can identify and leave some of the most beneficial ones in the growing beds.... Weeds are generally hardier than cultivated plants since they are genetically closer to their parental plant stock and nearer to the origin of the plant species." [102]
- "Like people in relationships, certain plants like or dislike each other, depending on the specific natures involved.... Weeds are often specialists in the plant community. Where cultivated garden plants cannot manage, weeds are able to draw phosphorus, potash, calcium, trace minerals and other nutrients out of the soil and subsoil and concentrate them in their bodies. Weeds can be used to concentrate nutrients for future fertilization or to withdraw noxious elements, such as unwanted salts, from the growing area."
- On companion planting: Green beans and strawberries. Lemon balm attracts bees. Marjoram, oregano, and valerian have beneficial effectss on surrounding plants. Stinging nettle helps neighboring plants to grow more resistant to spoiling and stimulates humus formation. Valerian helps most companions with disease resistance, stimulating phosphorus in its vicinity. [108]
- On food-raising natural ecosystems: "In a small backyard garden ecosystem, it is especially important to welcome all lifeforms as much as possible. Ants destroy fruit fly and housefly larvae and keep the garden clear of rotting debris. Earwigs prey on other insects. Tachinid flies parasitize caterpillars, earwigs, tomato worms, and grasshoppers... The first step in insect control is to cultivate strong, vigorous plants by cultivating a healthful place where they can grow. Normally, insects attack only unhealthy plants.... The insect is not the source of the problem, but rather unhealthy soil is."

### Square Foot Gardening, Mel Bartholomew
This is an practical and useful book for someone like myself, without a homestead or ideal sunlight hours over my garden. It's written in an entertaining and enthusiastic voice that makes me think that Mel would have been a good Youtuber. There are in depth "profiles" of common crops, but the best thing is a valuable reference on crop spacing and root needs.  The 4x4 garden recommendations helped me plan out my future fall garden immensely. 

#### Highlights
**Crop spacing per square foot:** 

Basil 1-4, Beans 8-10, Beets 9-16, Broccoli, 1, Brussle Sprout 1, Carrots 16, Celery 4, Cucumber 2, Kale 1, Leaf Lettuce 4, Leeks 9, Onions 16, Peas 8, Peppers 1, Potatoes 4, Pumpkins/Winter Squash 1 per 2 squares, Radishes 16, Spinach 9, Squash/Zuchinni 1, Tomatoes 1 per 4 squares,   

### The Ultimate Guide to Soil, Anna Hess
This readable overview of soil has good recommendations for how to test, build, and improve soil, mostly from the perspective of a homesteader. The author has a background in ecology and while the science is solid, I was hoping for a deeper dive into the interconnected soil matrix rather than instructive guides.
#### Highlights
"In the wild, plants are able to uptake sufficient phosphorus as the result of a partnership with microscopic fungi known as mycorrhizae. The mycorrhizal fungi in essence extend plant roots into much more distant and smaller cracks in the soil matrix than the host plants could ever dream of colonizing on their own. In the process, fungi suck up hard-to-find phosphorus along with other plant-friendly minerals like zinc and copper. Then, as a thank you for the mycorrhizae's hard work, the host plant feed their mycorrhizal partners with plenty of sugars that fungi couldn't readily create on their own."
