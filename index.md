# üå± About the Project
I'm coming up on 10 years in Brooklyn. Many flora and fauna have found a way to survive in the city despite the concrete, and it's about time I get to know them! This project is a field guide to my own yard and the 8 blocks around my apartment. I'd like to know the sidewalk shrubs as well as I do the local restaurants. At the same time I'll deepen my knowledge of the history of the land I occupy, gardening practices, and ecology.

#### Criteria
- Articles should be educational but casual
- Articles should have **local information** written for a general audience
- Articles should be surprising or delightful <code>(fun facts! nice drawings!)</code>

#### Constraints
- I don't need to finish an article every day, but every day should contribute to one
- Research does not count as a day. There must be interpretation.
- I can write, doodle, take photos, and go on field trips in any combination
- Honestly I'm taking it easy on this one.
