# White Clover *(trifolium repens)*
White clover's genus name trifolium derives from the lation tres, three, and folium, leaf, hence the popular name "trefoil"! Native to Europe and central Asia, clover is now a common crop in most grassy areas of North America. It was brought over as an excellent forage plant—bears, deer, birds, and livestock animals are all happy to graze on clover.[^1]

Clover is low maintainance and spreads aggressively; it is listed as an invasive species in the US.[^2] It forms mats across the ground and when nodes along the plant stem come into contact with soil they put out new roots. This allows the plant to creep, and it often goes unnoticed until early spring when its herbaceous white flowers emerge from the ground. Wait before you cut them down though! These flowers are a major food source for bumblebees and honeybees.

While I was growing up clover was considered a weed, but nowadays many people are using it as an alternative for typical lawn grasses.[^3] In addition to feeding a variety of species and being [nitrogen-fixers](tbd) they have great drought resistance, aerate the soil, and are soft underfoot. They can also provide some extra luck if you find one with four leaves!

### Fun Facts
- White clover is part of the bean family (Fabacae, or **Legum**inosae). You can see the resemblance when you [look at their tiny seeds](https://www.invasive.org/browse/detail.cfm?imgnum=5461285). Secret bean!
- Shamrock comes from the Irish *seamróg* which means "young clover" 
- Four leafed clovers are a genetic anomly. A 2017 survey of ~6 million clovers found that their frequency is about 1 in 5000.[^4]
- The helpful clover was only designated as a weed in the 50s because early herbicides killed it off along with dandelions.[^5] Seems pretty unfair.
