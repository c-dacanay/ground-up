# Zinnia 

Zinnia is a genus of plant that are native to North America with a centre of diversity in Mexico. These long-stemmed annual plants come in a variety of bright colors and are a standard flower in many home gardens due to how easy they are to grow. They also tend to attract hummingbirds and butterflies with their bright, twelve-petaled blooms.

These flowers bloom all throughout summer and benefit from deadheading (cutting off blooms so that more buds will grow from lower leaf nodes). Because of their apparent deer and whitefly-resistant properties, they're also common companion plants in gardens. I'm sure the pollinators appreciate their presence as well.

I was gifted several packs of "Fruit Smoothie Mixed Color" zinnias that have grown vigorously this summer. While I don't love the extremely bright fuchsias and oranges I've caught some bees napping on the blooms. So, they're sticking around.

### Fun Facts
- Zinnias can grow in weightless environments. We know this because it was the [first flower grown in the International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISS-46_Zinnia_flower_in_the_Cupola_(2).jpg)! 
- They're said to symbolize thoughts of absent friends, according to Almanac's flower meanings.[^1]
