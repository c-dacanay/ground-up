# Chickweed *(stellaria media)*

This annual member of the carnation family gets its name because it was a preferred feed for chicken and other birds.[^1] It is native to Eurasia but has been naturalized all over the world. Its small white flowers have 5 bifid petals that emerge from (usually) 5 green sepals, giving them a cheerful sunburst shape. While it is commonly considered undesirable in a lawn or garden chickweed has had many uses as a food and medicine. 

Chickweed is nutritious and is often used as a leaf veggie that can be added raw to salads. It has also been used as a remedy for itchy skin conditions and pulmonary diseases. There are records of hebalists prescribing chickweed for everything from anemia to arthritis. [^2]
