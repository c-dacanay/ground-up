# Herbs & Flowers

Herbs are the colloquial term for plants with savory or aromatic properties that are not consumed for macronutrients. Herbs and flowers have also been used for a variety of culinary, medicinal and ceremonial uses throughout history. They also tend to be *herbaceous*, meaning they are vascular plants with no woody stems above ground.

This category is admittedly fuzzy. If a herb is a plant grown primarily for its leaves, shouldn't lettuce be an herb? Broccoli heads are hundreds of flowers that have yet to bolt, so why is it considered a vegetable? Many flowers are edible, but we typically don't cultivate them as crops. 

The only real distinction I could make between these plants are "things we eat a lot of" and "things we don't think to eat as much, or if we do, it's kind of a garnish". But herbs and flowers are fascinating! Both of these types of plants have such deep roots in human history that we have whole languages about their meanings. 

I'm interested in learning about what keeps us cultivating some herbs and not others. Why do we all know parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme, but despite being raised Catholic I've never tasted myrrh in my life? I just learned myrrh is a tree sap/gum, but you get what I mean. I'm also curious about foraging and historical uses for some of these plants. What are the medicinal uses of stinging nettle? Why did yarrow make Achilles invincible? Can I eat a tulip? (spoiler: yes!)
