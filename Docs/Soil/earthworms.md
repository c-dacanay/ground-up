# Earthworm
Charles Darwin's last book was titled *The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms (1881)*. He said: “It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised creatures.”[^1] He may have been ridiculed at the time, but now any organic gardener would be overjoyed at finding a healthy smattering of earthworms in their compost or near the tops of their raised bed soil. 

### Disambiguating the Wyrm
For the sake of scope, this article is focused on earthworms. Wyrm was the Old English term for carnivorous reptiles ("serpents") and mythical dragons. It's worth noting though that in the 13th century, worms were recognized in Europe as part of the category of reptiles that consisted of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including "snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards, assorted amphibians". When you unearth one of our blind, wriggling, enigmatic friends, know that they have as much in common with dragons as serpents do!
