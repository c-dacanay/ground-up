# Fungi

Fungi have gained popularity in the public consciousness over the last few years, particularly during the pandemic. The early days lockdown created a whole generation of home growers who began to learn about the importance of fungi in soil. Enthusiastic and knowledgable foragers like [Alexis Nikole](https://www.instagram.com/blackforager/?hl=en) started sharing their mushroom expertise on TikTok. Home mushroom growing kits became a fun and edible alternative to houseplants. 

I started learning more about fungi as artists, mutual aid workers, and organizers started using mycelial networks as a metaphor to describe utopian, invisible systems of care. In *Braiding Sweetgrass*, Robin Wall Kimmerer described mutual flourishing between fungi and tree roots. “[Fungi] weave a web of reciprocity, of giving and taking. In this way, the trees all act as one because the fungi have connected them.”

Fungi are classified as a whole biological kingdom, meaning the group is as diverse as Animalia or Plantae.  In the past mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known that fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants. Fungi are the principle decomposers in all ecological systems, meaning that they are the ultimate soil helper. Fungi do not photosynthesize and, like animals, are heterotrophs, meaning they acquire food by absorbing dissolved molecules by secreting digestive enzymes into their environments. As they decompose organic matter they produce humus, a rich and fertile soil upon which plants can then feed. It's worth noting that mushrooms are rarely a concern in houseplant soil. In fact, the mycelial network may even make soil nutrients more available to your plant. (Unless, of course, the mushroom is feeding upon your plant's dead and rotten roots)

We've been having frequent and sporadic summer rains in the city this summer. After every rainfall there are at least a few mushrooms pop up from the ground or in the raised beds, though I'm not certain of their names. I *think* I've spotted inky caps and deer shields, but I will not be eating them to find out. Mushrooms are of course the fruiting bodies of the mycelium itself that allow it to spread more spores. Our backyard is quite bumpy; underneath the first inch of topsoil there are layers of construction materials. We've found bricks, rebar, glass, and rotten planks. Most of these man-made materials won't degrade within my lifetime, but I find it heartening that the fungi will do their best to restore the soil around them to keep things growing.
