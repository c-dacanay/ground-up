# Soil

The dirt is alive! If you were the kind of kid who would dig up creepy crawlies to gross out your siblings, you know this well. There's a lot to talk about down there, but more on soil formation and the [soil food web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_food_web#/media/File:Soil_food_webUSDA.jpg) a little bit later.

Soil is the place where it all begins and ends. It's the recycling center of the planet where the earth composts itself. Typically it is composed of a layer of organic matter like fallen leaves and decaying plants or animals that is progressively more broken down in lower layers until it's pure-mineral material. The ground beneath our feet carries the history of ancient seas, floods, glaciers and volcanoes. Pretty cool!

When talking about soil in the context of cultivation we generally talk about about [*soil texture*](). Gardeners and farmers almost always prefer a "loamy" soil because it's aerated, retains water and nutrients, but also drains well.

But the crops we cultivate and eat tend to have quite shallow root systems. A tomato plant might have roots that extend two feet below the plant. Compare that to some types of trees who's roots can sometimes go hundreds of feet down into the ground, breaking up bedrock and reducing erosion all the while.[^1] 

Many longtime gardeners develop a deep and near spiritual relationship with tending the earth. How could you not, really, after paying careful attention to how nature upholds and replenishes itself? Masanobu Fukoka wrote a book on his philosophy of Natural Farming, where he insisted that humans could never "know" nature and should aim to feed the soil as nature does.[^2] In the same vein Charles Dowding, the creator of the modern no-dig gardening movement, coined the phrase "feed the soil, not the plant".[^3] The soil—in the raised bed, over the landfill, beneath the concrete—is the foundation upon which we all rely. 

<!-- Soil texture is determined by its composition of clay, silt, and sand. All of these terms describe the same thing: bedrock, crushed into little pieces. The only difference is the size of the bedrock particles.[^1] -->

<!-- **Sand** is the largest partical size. Sandy soil has large spaces between their particles, so it tends to dry out and heat up more easily. **Clay** has the smallest particles that stick together in masses. If you notice part a part of a park that turns into a pond for days after it rains it might have very clay soil. **Silt** particles are somewhere in the middle. While some plant life enjoys highly sandy or clay soil, most gardeners and farmers want a well-balanced mixture of all these three types for crop cultivation. A balanced soil texture is called a "loamy" soil that is aerated, retains water and nutrients, but also drains well. -->

## that makes me think of
- Burial rites:
    - How great effort has been taken to transport the dead back to their country of origin, even during wartimes 
    - How embalming delays decomposition in pursuit of immortality
    - How scattered ashes are an excellent fertilizer
- Yard management:
    - How leaves are put in plastic bags and removed so they cannot feed the soil around the tree, and insect larvae die
- Concrete:
    - How it covers the most fertile layer of soil
    - How it acts like a terrible mulch; absorbing incredible amounts of heat, creating heat islands, but allowing the soil underneath to stay protected. (Canopies also do this)
