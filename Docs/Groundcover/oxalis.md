# Oxalis 
Oxalis is a large genus of flowering plants that are present all over the world, but they're particularly diverse in tropical Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. They're commonly referred to as wood sorrels and are a popular forage, as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper *(Rumex acetosa)*, which is distantly related.[^1] It has commonly been used in teas, salads, and some species even have edible tubers.

In the spring and fall when the blooms on oxalis wane they can be mistaken for three-petaled clover from afar. The differences in the petals are subtle, but clover has an ovoid leaf while oxalis has a more pronounced heart-shape to most of its petals. It also has small, spear-like fruits.

I probably have Common Yellow Wood Sorrel *(oxalis stricta)* in my yard. I learned to tell it apart from clover first due to the fact that the petals shrink back and fold in on themselves at night before they wake themselves up in the morning. I was surprised to learn that these common garden weeds are closely related to the popular burgandy houseplant with sharp trinagular leaves called [oxalis triangularis](https://bloomscape.com/plant-care-guide/oxalis/).
