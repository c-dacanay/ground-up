# Lamb's Quarters *(chenopodium album)*

Lamb's quarters is a relative of amaranth and an annual so-called weed. They go by many names—white goosefoot, fat hen, melde, pigweed, wild spinach—and many of their names reference the soft white fur on their spring shoots. Its most common name is in reference to the English harvest festival *Lammas quarters*, named of this plant's growth and with sacraficial lambs. The alternate leaves look like goose feet, hence its other nickname goosefoot! 

These and other members of the amaranth family have a well-deserved reputation among botanists for being difficult to identify to species. There are over 20 species in genus *chenopodium*, but Lamb's Quarters fur make it a bit easier to identify. Apparently it originated in Europe, but it has been naturalized for so long it reveals the trouble with the native/invasive dichotomy. While it's widespread and prolific this species does not typically invade healthy natural communities to a great extent. Instead it typically finds purchase in places where soil has been disturbed or removed like roadsides, railroads, or fallow fields.[^1]

This is true in my garden as well. A healthy crop of Lamb's Quarters have sprouted up where the previous occupants kept a storage container. 

<!-- - Edible, can be prepared similarly to spinach, packed with nutrients
- Weed, leaves look like the foot of a goose, white fur
