# Groundcover
In North America we're used to seeing groundcover in the form of lawns, typically seeded with grasses. Groundcover is important to prevent erosion, suppress weeds, and reduce soil water loss. In this section I'll be looking into some of the common grasses around New York, as well as some alternative groundcovers that might be more beneficial to the soil. But first, here's a question I've been curious about for a while:

## Where did lawns come from?
Lawns make more sense where they originated in Europe because of the moist, mild climate that supports close-cut grasslands. Medieval castles in France in Britain had *laundes* (glades, in Middle English) kept clear of trees to see incoming visitors who may or may not be hostile. Villages also had laundes kept in the commons where sheep and cattle could graze. These domesticated vegetarians naturally kept the grasses low and fertilized as they ate.

Immigrants brought this idea, and grass seeds, with them to North America. After massive amounts of land was violently disowned from indigenous peoples, lawns were considered a status symbol for the wealthyâ€”lawns were big and expensive to maintain. In the mid 19th century when cities became increasingly industrialized, beautification campaigns introduced the idea of "parks". This term had originally referred to large decorative lawns around wealthy English homes, and as such most American parks adhere to those conventions with trimmed shrubs, manicured trees, and water features.[^1]

Lawns became even more popular during the creation of the suburbs due to white flight and the housing boom post-World War II. Every new homeowner wanted their own little park. Well-maintained lawns became a symbol of a functional household filled with hardworking Americans who would maintain it even on their days of leisure. They're so ubiquitous now that we even keep them in aird, humid places like Arizona that has percipitation as low as 3 inches per year!

In a time of climate change lawns have recieved some well due scrutiny. Many people use synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to grow grass, basically just so they can trim it. These products harm local wildlife and the chemicals can end up in drinking water. Moreover, lawns require **a lot** of water. Nationwide, Americans use about 9 billion gallons per day to water their lawns.[^2] What the hell!

<!-- If you want a "better lawn", just stop fertilizing and putting pesticides on it. Leave fallen leaves and grass trimmings where they fall so they can reinvigorate the soil. The boldest move is to stop watering and just see what happens. Maybe the kentucky bluegrass dies out and more helpful, drought-resistent "weeds" step in. Clover fixes nitrogen! Dandelions fertilize the soil! Purslane can grow out of cracks in concrete! -->
