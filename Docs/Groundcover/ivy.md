# Ivy *(Hedera)*
This climbing evergreen is part of the ginseng family (*Araliaceae*), native to much of Europe, Asia, and northwest Africa. In urban environments in the northeast we often see this plant clothing brick walls or climbing up tree trunks. We have some English ivy that climbs up our back wall onto the fence of the parking lot that overlooks our back yard and it grants some well-appreciated privacy. 

Most ivy species creep or climb by aerial roots that can grab onto, or even into things. Like all creeping plants they can sprout root nodes from any part of the stem that is in contact with soil. They often have three or five lobed leaves. They are easy-to-grow houseplants as well; they can survive in poor soil and prefer a bit of shade, which also allows them to thrive under tree canopies. 

Ivies are of major ecological importance due to their nectar and fruit production, which happens when there are few other food sources available to birds and insects. A wide range of things take shelter and overwinter in dense tangles of ivy. 

### Fun Facts
- Poison Ivy, is not a true ivy! *Toxicodendron radicans* is a member of the cashew and pistachio family Anacardiceae. Shame on us for mistaking it and giving the friendly ivy a bad reputation.
- Bacchus is often depicted wearing a wreath of ivy because in Ancient Rome it was believed such a wreath could prevent a person from becoming drunk.[^1]
- The clinging nature of ivy makes it a symbol of love and friendship, and there was once a tradition of priests giving ivy to newlyweds.
- The *Ivy Leagues* was a name inspired by the image of old, ivy-mantled walls, originally in reference to a conference of football teams agreeing to play games by set rules. [^2]
