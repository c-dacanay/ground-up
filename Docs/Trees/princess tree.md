# Princess Tree *(Paulownia tomentosa)*

Princess trees, also known as Empress trees, are native to Asia and were introduced to North America in the 1840s as an ornamental. In April and May it produces beautiful, two inch foxglove-like blooms that hang like clustered bells. Because of its tolerance and flexibility, these trees functions as pioneer plants. They have nitrogen-rich leaves that provide good compost and its roots prevent erosion.[^1] There are several in my neighborhood here in Brooklyn; they're tolerant of pollution and aren't picky about soil types, which allows them to eagerly take root in rain gardens and pavement cracks. 

The Princess tree's large foliage and pretty blooms make it a popular "architectural" plant in landscaping. Its wood is 30% lighter than any comparable American hardwood, falling mid-way between balsa and poplar. As such, it's been a popular woodworking medium particularly in Japan. Tansu dressers, kotos, and geta wooden clogs are all commonly made of paulownia.[^2] 

One of my neighbors has one that's over 20 feet tall and produces egg-shaped fruits that, when fall or are opened, disperse seemingly countless tiny seeds. he soft, lightweight seeds were commonly used as a packing material by Chinese porcelain exporters in the 19th century, before the development of polystyrene packaging. One botanist projected that a single tree could produce up to 21 million seeds![^3] This spring I weeded out over ten seeds that took root, but you can imagine how such a productive and fast-growing tree could be an issue as an invasive species.
