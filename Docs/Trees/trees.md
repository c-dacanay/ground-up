# Trees and Shrubs
A friend once said that it's much easier to identify trees in a forest than it is in New York City. A limited number of species thrive in any particular habitat, and when seeds drop onto the forest floor they most likely came from a nearby parent. In cities we ship trees and shrubs from all over to beautify the few patches of green between sidewalks and concrete. There are trees native to the US, Spain, Norway and Japan on my one block in Brooklyn alone. 

Like all city-things, tree are registered residents! There's a fun [New York City tree map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/) where you can check on recent tree care activities in your neighborhood. Hilariously all trees also have a "Total Value of Annual Benefits" that calculates dollar amounts of how much each tree saves the city in stormwater management and energy conservation. The Kentucky yellowwood outside my apartment produced $34.49 last year—good job I guess? 

While I'd bet no tree prefers an urban environment, they do a lot of important work for us city dwellers. The trees who can survive the soot and dust of the city act as natural air filters. Dust and other pollutants that are collected by leaves are washed away by the rain instead of being carried in the air. They also serve as windbreaks and shelters for people and animals.[^1]

When I lived in Baltimore the easiest way to tell if a neighborhood was affluent was to look for trees. Inequity is visible from space. The city has a long and persistent history of redlining and there are miles of city blocks without a single tree. In the summer the sweltering heat would make waiting for busses oppresive or even dangerous. One study reported an 8 Fahrenheit difference between the coolest and hottest neighborhoods in the city, all due to tree canopy. Jad Daley, president and CEO of American Forests said “trees are not just scenery. They’re critical infrastructure for the health and wealth and well-being of communities.”[^2]
