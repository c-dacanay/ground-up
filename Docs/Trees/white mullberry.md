# White Mulberry *(morus alba)*
The white mulberry tree in my back yard was the first thing to leaf out in spring. Within a few weeks the foliage hid the parking lot behind our building from view and it began to set out long, fuzzy-looking flowers from nearly every leaf node. In the last week of May the flowers exploded into fruit and sheafs of white and purple berries would fall from its leaves and onto the shady ground below. Birds snacked and chatted in the tree all day, and the rotted fruit on the ground were eaten by bacteria and fungi to return to the soil. Now, in mid-June, the tree remains prolific. The mullberry branches droop with the weight of its fruit but even then I'm still too short to be able to pick berries easily. The ones I've tasted are mild and only slightly sweet.

Morus alba are native to China and India, where they were cultivated to feed silkworms in commercial silk production.[^1] At this point they've been naturalized widely across the globe as a decorative garden tree. It's attractive to wildlife, supplies free fruit, and has a dramatic canopy that provides shade and privacy. There are nearly 7,000 registered streetside mulberries in New York City, not including the ones in parks and my own back yard. These trees are generally short-lived compared to most with a lifespan comprable to that of most humans. It makes some intuitive sense, given how readily birds drop mulberry seeds to grow and make fruit elsewhere.

Mulberry tree have been used for much more than decoration throughout human history. In addition to being the preferred feedstock for silkworms, the bark has been used for textiles and medicine, the leaves can be prepared as tea, and the berries can be used for all types of things that berries are used for.[^2] There are fruitless varieties due to the "mess on sidewalks and driveways", but I'm quite grateful for our messy berry tree. I'll have to lay a small bowl out next year to try and get my share of fruit as well! 

### Fun Facts
- In the US we have a native red mulberry, but birds have spread its white counterpart so much that in many places it is more common.
- Because it's non-native and some people absolutely hate how messy the berries can be, it's freqently labeled as a "noxious weed".[^3] Dang.
- It's leaf shape changes as the plant gets more established. Leaves in early spring develop 5 to 7 lobes, but by summer new leaves assume a simple mitten shape.[^4] I assume this is because newer branches are more fragile and therefore need reduced wind resistence? But who knows!
