# Painted Lady Butterfly *(Vanessa cardui)*
As soon as breezy, mild May gave way to a muggy June these butterflies began sporatically visiting my humble garden. They perched from clover to clover before visiting the flowering thai basil. Butterflies are a rare sight in NYC; I don't recall seeing any outside the forested paths of Prospect Park. At first I thought it was a Monarch due to its flashy white, black, and orange coloring, but the ventral sides of its wings were stark enough to set it apart. 

Painted Lady butterflies, formerly known in North America as Cosmopolitans, are one of the most widespread butterfly species. They're large-ish for butterflies, around 2-2.5", and they're found on every continent except Antarctica and South America. I couldn't be sure if the butterflies I've seen were *vanessa virginiensis*, our native Painted Lady here in North America, but these butterflies are unique for not going dormant in the winter. Instead they partake in long migrations to warmer climates. Host plants include thistle, mallows, hollyhock, legumes, and others.[^1] I wonder if these caterpillars were responsible for beating up the leaves of some of my bush beans...
