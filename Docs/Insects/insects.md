# Insects
This is a silly thing to say, but until I started a garden I had forgotten just how many bugs there are. There are only a few you need to remember in city living: the good ones (fireflies, butertflies), bad ones (mosquitos, fruit flies), and very bad ones (cockroaches, bed bugs). Now I look at a single tomato plant and see like 12 new guys! Who are they?!

There are about 1 million insect species that have been documented and studied, meaning that they currently represent 40% of all known living species. Scientists estimate that there may actually be between 10 and 30 million species of insects on the planet.[^1]

Farmers and gardeners usually categorize insects into pollinators, beneficials, and pests. You actually need all three to have a happy and productive garden. For the sake of this project I'll be focusing on a small number of insects that fall in those three categories, of course with a preference for insects I see (or would like to see) for myself!
