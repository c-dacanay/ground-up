# Aphid *(aphidoidea)*
Ah, aphids. If you know a gardener they have probably complained about aphids at some point. These tiny insects are soft-bodied and slow moving, but because they can reproduce asexually it doesn't take long for an infestation to do some serious damage to plant life. There are over 1,300 species of aphids in North America alone, so they come in all shapes and colors.[^1] In my garden I've had close encounters with green, purple-ish, and black aphids that look suspiciously like fungus gnats. 

These small insects feed on plant sap, so they can reduce the strength of the plant and make them more succeptible to plant viruses. As they eat they excrete a sugar-rich sap called honeydew. Ants, and sometimes bees, can feed on this honeydew! Some species of ants even farm aphids, protecting them from preadatory animals and taking their eggs back to the colony to overwinter so they can be deposted onto new growth in the spring.[^2]

Aphid reproduction, however troublesome for gardeners, is fanscinating. They're clonal, meaning they're descended from a single female parthenogenetically and share an identical genome. An aphid can birth 60-100 live nymphs in a single day, and many of those nymphs may already be pregnant! Scientists call this adaptation *telescoping generations*, because an aphid can be developing its grandchild before it's child is even born![^3]

### Aphid Control
Aphid infestation can actually be a useful indication that your soil is too fertilized. Gardeners tend to feed their plants lots of nitrogen to encourage fast, leafy growth. Aphids *love* the nitrogen heavy sap as well. 

Aphids are also pretty dang weak. A strong jet of water on the underside of leaves can make quick work of them, and their life cycle is so short that if nymphs have to walk all the way up to the plant they may die off. That said, a garden blog called aphids "the gummy bear of nature"â€”everything wants to eat them.[^4] The easiest way to control your aphid population is to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs, hoverflies and lacewings.
