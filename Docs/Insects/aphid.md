# Aphids
Ah, aphids. If you know a gardener they have probably complained about aphids at one point or another. These tiny insects are soft-bodied and slow moving, but because they can reproduce asexually it doesn't take long for an infestation to do some serious damage to plant life.

### Aphid Control
Aphid infestation can actually be a useful indication that your soil is too fertilized! Gardeners tend to feed their plants lots of nitrogen to encourage fast, leafy growth. Aphids love to snack on tender leaves and they *love* the nitrogen heavy sap as well. 

Aphids are also, well, pretty dang weak. A strong jet of water on the underside of leaves can make quick work of them. 

The easiest way to control your aphid population is to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs, hoverflies,  -->
