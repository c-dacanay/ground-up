# Lady Beetle *(coccinellidae)*
There's lady beetle larvae in my garden! I feel like I've caught a shiny pokemon!! They're the poster child of beneficial insects and one of the most beloved in the world. Not only are they're cute, they're also voracious pest eaters. The number of [aphids](./aphid.html) that lady beetles eat per day is contensted but we know it's a lot. Adults are reported to feed on 20-60 per day, but it's well known that the larvae can consume 10 times that number. 

Gardeners crave for lady beetles to relievmovee them of those soft-bodied pests so much so that they are available for purchase by the thousands as a form of "biological pest control". It's easy to see why that's not a great idea. These beetles are often harvested from the wild and refrigerated which puts native populations at risk for competitors to encroach on their habitats. Not to mention, uh, these migratory insects can fly. [They can leave](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/530/511/eb3).

> Whitney Cranshaw, a professor and Extension entomologist with Colorado State University, has released lady beetles into his greenhouse several times to feed on aphid-infested plants, only to report negative results. "Twenty-four hours later I can find about six in the greenhouse after releasing a bag of 1,500," Cranshaw said. "Which means 1,494 largely vanished somewhere in that period. And I do not see any laying eggs for a few weeks."[^1]

I'm learning that the best way to attract anything in the garden is to create an environment that acts as an invitation. I stopped fussing over aphids because it's too much of a bother. If some plants succumbed to them, que sera sera, but I'm very pleased to have found that some lady beetle friends might volunteer their services.

The larvae I found nestled under strawberry leaves [spooked me a little](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/MIII8004.jpg) <code>cw: bug pic</code>! It was black and orange with threataning-looking spikes. *Harmonia axyridis* is, of course, one of the worst invasive insect species in North American. Sigh. I'll still take the beneficial win when I can get it.

### hail ladybug, full of grace
I grew up calling these insects ladybugs, but they're not "true bugs" in the entomological sense.[^2] They're alternatively called lady beetles, ladybirds, lady bird beetles... but these insects are sexually dimorphic, so how'd they get their name?

Surprise Christianity! The *lady* part of ladybug refers to the Virgin Mother Mary. There are a couple of apocryphal stories about why that is. One story goes that in the Middle Ages farmers without pesticides prayed to Mary for protection and she sent a swarm of lady beetles to save the crops. The other story is that they were associated with Mary because paintings often portrayed her in a red cloak and *coccinella septempunctata*, the most common lady beetle species in Europe, has 7 spots that were said to depict Mary's 7 joys and sorrows.[^3]
