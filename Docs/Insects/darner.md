# Green Darner Dragonfly *(anax junius)*
slender insect resting on the strawberry leaves with a round green body, latticed oval eyes, and a shocking metallic blue-black abdomen that looked like glass in the morning sun. The darner dragonfly is something I had caught numerous times in videogames, but I was surprised by how large the bug was in real life! Three inches may not sound like a lot, but when you're used to seeing bugs that are about half an inch it can cause quite a shock. The one I saw was likely a male, as they have intense blue abdomens while females are a deep reddish-brown.

Dragonflies are all aerial predators that eat all types of gnats, flies, butterflies and mosquitos. Their immature children are called naiads who live in ponds and can even eat small fish or tadpoles.

The green darner's latin name, Anax Junius, most directly translates to Lord of June, as Anax is a Greek word meaning lord, king, or master. Darner dragonflies (family: Aeshnidae) are also nicknamed “devil’s darning needles,” “mosquito hawks,” or “horse stingers,” although they don’t possess any stingers.[^1]
