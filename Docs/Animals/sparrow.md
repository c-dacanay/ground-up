# House Sparrow *(passer domesticus)*
If you've ever walked a tree-lined city block and had your conversation drowned out by [noisy chirps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV1PMs0C5Eo) you've likely passed under a colony of house sparrows!

These handsome, chatty songbirds are a familiar sight to most people in urban North America. They get their name because they prefer to nest in manmade structures like eaves, rain gutters, and street lights. 

They are actually native to Europe, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia.[^1] They were said to be introduced into Brooklyn in 1850s to control insect popoulations.[^2] They eat some insects, but they actually prefer weed and grass seeds (and of course, crumbs left by humans). House sparrows are known to be bullies in the bird world; they sometimes even evict native birds out of their own nests.

Like many birds house sparrows mate for life, but pairs often create loose colonies of around 10 or 20 birds. That's why there's so much crosstalk! These colonies nest and take dust baths together. If you notice a sparrow defending a small depression in the ground, that may be its favorite bathing spot.[^3]
