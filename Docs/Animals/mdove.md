# Mourning Dove *(zenadia macoura)*
Mourning doves are known for their soft, doleful calls. I sometimes hear them in the early morning before the bustle of the rush hour traffic. They also have a distinct fluttery wing whistle when they take flight and land.[^1] This bird is also colloquially called the turtle dove, or the rain dove.
