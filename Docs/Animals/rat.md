# Brown Rat *(rattus norvegicus)*
There's an urban legend that there are five rats for every person in NYC. According to a 2014 study, there is probably only one rat for every four people in the city, about 2 million! That's not too bad, right?[^1]

The brown rat makes up most of that rat population and it's know by many names: common rat, sewer rat, street rat, or Hanover rat. Selective breeding from this species have produced fancy rats, kept as pets, and the labratory rat, used as model organisims in bio research. 

New York is particularly well suited for rats. We have massive amounts of trash to take out, 

### Fun Facts
- Unlike most mammals, a rat's skull is not plated together. This means it can change the shape of its head to squeeze through holes as small as a quarter.
- Rats are homebodies; they rarely travel more than 600 feet from where they were born.[^2]
