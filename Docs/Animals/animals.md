# Animals
If you look up "Animals in NYC" the parks department mentiones coyotes, deer, and even seal that show up in the NYC area around November! "There's cool wildlife in the city (mostly Staten Island and the Bronx), I swear!" But **we** know the types of animals that live here full time—not Fashion Week tourists like that fancy Central Park duck. 

I can't help but feel an affinity toward the rats, pigeons, feral cats, and raccoons. We go about our days and we mind our own business, and we love the food. The city suits us. 

Still, it's a idealistic to say that animals simply moved in to cities because it suits them. Species found in urban ecosystems are called *synurbic*, and *synurbization* refers to the effects of urbanization on the adaptaion of wildlife.[^1] As cities expanded the local wildlife's range shrank. For every animal that adapted to or even preferred the concrete jungle, countless others could not.

Humans usually don't love animals that make themselves too known in cities. We've "gone to war" on emus, crows, sparrows, spotted lantern flies, you name it. These wars tend not to deter our clever neighbors for long. The mayor of NYC recently appointed a rat czar to reduce the city's rat population.[^2] Surely the rats will respect the czar.

Aside from humans, urban environments have their share of perils like electric lines, glass windows, and pollution. For the animals that live here the benefits outweigh the cost. Food is abundant in cities, and it's much easier to scavange than it is to hunt. The urban heat island effect is great for animals that prefer the warmth.

Koichi Karasawa, a volunteer for the Urban Bird Society of Japan, wisely said of Japanese urban crows: “They’re a barometer measuring our society... We analyzed the reason behind [their population] growth, and came to the conclusion that it had to do with how the Japanese lost their frugality and embraced mass production and consumption as the nation prospered.”[^3] They moved in because Japan started producing more garbage, and the crows were kind enough to make use of it for them.

When building the first cities we probably thought they were creating a human fortress that shut out the rest of the world, but we're just one clever animal in a world filled with clever animals. It's inevitable that some animals joined us. In this section I'll be looking in to the many undomesticated birds and mammals that live by our sides.
