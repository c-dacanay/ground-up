# Crops
Crops are plants that we cultivate, aka: domesticated plants. These plants have shaped and been shaped by human evolution much like dogs: sometimes they're bred for beauty, other times they're bred to work. Naturally it's much simpler and faster to genetically modify a plant than a mammal. There are only about 200 recognized dog breeds, but there are more than 10,000 tomato cultivars on the market![^1] 

## GMOs vs. Hybrids vs. Heirlooms
A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an animal, plant, or microbe whose DNA has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. If you hand-pollinate a hot pepper and a sweet pepper and end up with seeds from a strangely spicy bell, you've *technically* created a GMO. In the gardening world, though, that's just a hybrid. In Joseph Tychonievich’s book *Plant Breeding for the Home Gardener* he describes an important distinction: “Traditional breeding introduces genetic diversity by bringing together all genes of two individuals, most of which have nothing to do with specific breeding aims. Genetic engineering instead inserts only one gene, one specific section of new DNA, into a single individual’s genome…”[^2]

**GMOs** are always created in a lab and involve gene splicing. You'll never be able to cross breed corn and peppers in your garden, but a GMO pepper seed might have some genes from a disease-resistant corn. Because GMO gene splicing can happen at a bacterial level, they have produced things like their own poisons or resistance to herbicides. These things can have a disasterous effect on the environment in large-scale agricultural farms, especially because these farms typically monoculture for increased yields. While GMOs might not be good for the planet, there is still no research that shows that resulting produce have any negative affects when eaten by humans.

**Hybrids** are cross-pollinated by hand, and they're always produced with two genetically different plants of the same type. Tomato, tomato. Hyrbid plants are still designed to have desirable traits like pest resistance or a more compact growth. Hybrids are often unstable, meaning if you save the seeds from the fruit of a hybrid, you will produce produce a plant that does not contain the mixed traits of its parents. So if you find a hybrid you really like to grow, you'll probably be paying that seed company for a while.

**Heirloom** varieties have existed for... well, a while. There are different schools of thought on what defines an "heirloom", some say the seed lineage needs to be 100 years old, or 50, or recorded before 1945 (the advent of plant hyrbidization). In any case, heirloom seeds are stable and true-to-type, meaning that if you save seed from an heirloom plant you can replant the exact same variety year after year. There are many heirloom seeds that have also been adapted to different climates and growing environments, and they tend to be the gardener's favorite because seed-saving increases self-sufficiency. Not to mention, these seeds probably produce things you aren't used to seeing at a grocery store![^3]
